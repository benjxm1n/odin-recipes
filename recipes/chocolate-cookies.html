  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>½ cup Vegan Butter</li>
    <li>½ cup White Granulated Sugar</li>
    <li>½ cup Light Brown Sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract</li>
    <li>1 cup All Purpose Flour</li>
    <li>⅔ cup Cocoa Powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Baking Soda</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon Salt</li>
    <li>1 Tablespoon Soy Milk</li>
    <li>1 cup vegan chocolate chips</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).</li>
    <li>Add the vegan butter and brown and white sugar to the bowl of your stand mixer and cream them together. Add the vanilla extract and mix in.</li>
    <li>Sift the flour and cocoa powder into a separate mixing bowl and mix in the baking soda and salt.</li>
    <li>Add the dry ingredients to the wet, mixing in by hand until crumbly.</li>
    <li>Add the 1 Tablespoon soy milk or other non-dairy milk and mix into a thick cookie dough.</li>
    <li>Add the chocolate chips and mix in. Your cookie dough will be very thick, but sticky enough to easily roll into balls.</li>
    <li>Roll into balls and space them evenly on a parchment lined baking tray. Aim to get 20 cookies from the batch.</li>
    <li>Bake for 10 minutes. The edges will be firm but the cookies will still be soft in the middle. This is fine, they will firm up as they cool.</li>
    <li>Press in a few more chocolate chips to the top of the cookies as they come out of the oven.</li>
  </ol>
